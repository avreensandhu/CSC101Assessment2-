        "STEP 1: Understand the Problem In your own words, what is this program supposed to do? (2–3 sentences) Example answer you can use: This program calculates how much tip should be added to a restaurant bill. The user enters the bill amount and the tip percentage, and the program works out the tip amount and the total cost. It helps staff quickly determine how much to charge the customer. STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs INPUTS: Bill amount Type: Number (decimal) Tip percentage Type: Number (integer or decimal)\n",
        "This program calculates the tip amount and the total amount to be paid after adding the tip to a restaurant bill. It takes the initial bill amount and a tip percentage as inputs, then computes and displays the tip amount and the final total.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "OUTPUTS: What the program shows back Tip amount — the dollar value of the tip (e.g., $6.87). Total amount to charge — bill + tip (e.g., $52.67). (Optional) a short summary line like: Bill: $45.80 | Tip (15%): $6.87 | Total: $52.67. What format Currency format with two decimal places (e.g., $xx.xx). Numeric outputs (floats) formatted as currency strings for staff readability. If you add a GUI or receipt printout, show the three values each on its own line. STEP 3: Work It By Hand (showing each calculation) Given: Bill amount = $45.80 Tip percentage = 15% Step A — Convert percent to decimal 15% → 0.15 Step B — Calculate tip amount We calculate 45.80 × 0.15 45.80×0.15. I’ll do this in two easy parts (10% + 5%) so it’s clear: 10% of $45.80 = move decimal one place = $4.58 5% of $45.80 = half of 10% = $4.58 ÷ 2 = $2.29 Add those: $4.58 + $2.29 = $6.87 (So 45.80 × 0.15 = 6.87 45.80×0.15=6.87.) Step C — Calculate total amount Add bill + tip: $45.80 + $6.87 Add cents: 80¢ + 87¢ = 167¢ → 1 dollar and 67¢ (carry $1) Add dollars: 45 + 6 + 1 (carried) = 52 → $52.67 Final values Tip amount = $6.87 Total amount to charge = $52.67 What I would tell the staff member (one-line) “Tip: $6.87 — Total to charge: $52.67.”\n",
        "Thank you for the detailed breakdown! The current program's output for the given bill and tip percentage indeed matches your manual calculation, displaying the tip amount as $6.87 and the total amount as $$6.87 and the total amount as $52.67, formatted to two decimal places.\n",

        "STEP 1: Understand the Problem This program calculates the late fine for a library book based on how many days it’s overdue. The librarian enters the number of days late and the program returns the fine amount, with a maximum fine of $10.00. STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs INPUTS: Days overdue — Number (integer; e.g., 5) OUTPUTS: Fine amount — Currency formatted with two decimal places (e.g., $2.50). Special case: If the calculated fine exceeds $10.00, show “Maximum fine reached ($10.00)” (or simply output $10.00). STEP 3: Work It By Hand Rule: fine = days_overdue × $0.50, capped at $10.00. Case A: Book is 5 days late My calculation: Multiply days × rate: 5 × 0.50 5×0.50. 5 × 0.50 = 2.50 5×0.50=2.50. Fine: $2.50 Case B: Book is 25 days late My calculation: Multiply days × rate: 25 × 0.50 25×0.50. 25 × 0.50 = 12.50 25×0.50=12.50. Apply cap: 12.50 > 10.00 → set fine = 10.00. Fine: Maximum fine reached ($10.00) or $10.00 Special note: The raw calculation gives $12.50, but the library enforces a maximum fine of $10.00, so the charged fine is capped. Case C: Book is 0 days late My calculation: 0 × 0.50 = 0.00 0×0.50=0.00. Fine: $0.00\n",
        "Thank you for the clear and thorough explanation of the library late fee program! The code I provided earlier (in cell 3e080c2f) accurately reflects these rules, including the cap at $10.00. It will correctly calculate fines for 5 days late ($$10.00. It will correctly calculate fines for 5 days late ($2.50), 25 days late (capped at $10.00), and 0 days late ($$10.00), and 0 days late ($0.00).\n",

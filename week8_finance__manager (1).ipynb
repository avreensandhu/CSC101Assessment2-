        "*   **Functionality Implementation:** All required Python functions (`parse_transaction`, `process_transactions`, `analyze_transactions`, `display_summary`) were successfully defined and implemented according to specifications.\n",
        "*   **Robust Parsing:** The `parse_transaction` function effectively handles various error cases, including empty lines, lines missing a comma, and lines with non-numeric amounts, returning `None` for corrupted entries.\n",
        "*   **Transaction Processing:** The `process_transactions` function successfully integrated `parse_transaction`, collecting valid transactions and accurately counting failed parsing attempts.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The `analyze_transactions` function correctly calculated total valid transactions, total income (positive amounts), total expenses (negative amounts), and the net amount from parsed transactions.\n",
        "*   **Clear Summary Display:** The `display_summary` function provided a well-formatted and comprehensive output of the analysis results.\n",
        "*   **Demonstration Results:** Using a sample list of transactions, the system processed the data as follows:\n",
        "    *   **5** transactions were successfully parsed and deemed valid.\n",
        "    *   **3** transactions failed to parse due to invalid formats (empty string, missing comma, or non-numeric amount).\n",
        "    *   The total income from valid transactions was \\$3020.00.\n",
        "    *   The total expenses from valid transactions were \\$-121.25.\n",
        "    *   The net amount (income + expenses) was \\$2898.75.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The implemented system provides a robust foundation for basic financial transaction processing, effectively handling common data quality issues such as malformed entries.\n",
        "*   **Next Step:** To enhance functionality, consider adding features like categorization of transactions (e.g., 'Groceries', 'Rent') and persistent storage of transactions (e.g., to a CSV file or database).\n"
